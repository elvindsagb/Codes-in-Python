Given a matrix of size n X m, find the transpose of the matrix. Transpose of a matrix is obtained by changing rows to columns and columns to rows. In other words, transpose of mat[n][m] is obtained by changing mat[i][j] to mat[j][i].

Run a nested loop using two integer pointers i and j for 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m
Set mat[i][j] equal to mat[j][i]

SOLUTION:-
def transpose(matrix):
    rows=len(matrix)
    cols=len(matrix[0])
    transpose = [[0 for i in range(rows)] for i in range(cols)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            transpose[j][i] = matrix[i][j]
    return transpose

rows=int(input("Enter the number of rows"))
cols=int(input("Enter the number of columns"))
matrix=[]
for i in range(rows):
    row=list(map(int,input().split()))
    matrix.append(row)
result=transpose(matrix)
print("Transpose Matrix")
for row in result:
    print(" ".join(map(str, row)))
